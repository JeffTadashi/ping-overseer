Description: # ping-overseer
        
        This is a mass ping monitoring tool with the following features:
        
        - Easily input a list of IP's from any source
        - Ping monitors IP's in real time
        - Constantly displays what IP's are down
        - Highlights for longer downtime IP's
        
        This is based on some functionality from PingInfoView. However, I needed something that ran on MacOS, thus this project was born!
        
        I mainly use this for real-time work during network switch cutovers. It is meant to be a short-term tool (minutes/hours of usage), not something for monitoing over days.
